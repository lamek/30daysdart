# 30 Days of Dart

This is a copy of [LeetCode's 30 days of JavaScript](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/),
but for Dart.

This is mostly a learning project for me.

Solutions to problems are AI-generated, then "human-annotated". The beginner
exercises are a combined (human/ai) effort.
